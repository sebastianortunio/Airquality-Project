# Airquality-Project

This R project involves cleaning, transforming, and visualizing the airquality dataset, which contains air quality data from New York. The main tasks include:

## Handling Missing Values: 
- The project begins by addressing missing values in the Ozone and Solar.R columns by replacing them with the median of each respective column.
## Adding New Variables: 
- A new variable, Solar.R.Danger, is created to flag when solar radiation exceeds 100, which could indicate potentially dangerous levels.
## Data Transformation: 
- The Month column is transformed from numeric values (1 to 12) into descriptive month names (e.g., 1 becomes "January").
## Data Visualization:
## Temperature Trends: 
A line plot is created to show the overall temperature trend across the months, helping to visualize temperature fluctuations over the year.
## Monthly Temperature Analysis: 
Specific plots for individual months (May, June, July, and September) are made to examine temperature patterns more closely:

- A line plot for May to show daily temperature changes.

- A box plot for September to show the spread and distribution of temperatures.

Throughout this project, I explored different types of visualizations, including line plots, point plots, and box plots, to better understand and present the trends in air quality and temperature data.
